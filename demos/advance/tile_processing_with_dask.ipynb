For every tile, we will fetch a device, load the tile in it, process it to get the number of cell, and write the number in a pixel of an output image. Hence, we are producing a cell-count image that is smaller than the original image by a factor that corresponds to the tile size."

    "For counting the nuclei, we setup a simple image processing workflow that applies Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling to the dataset. Afterwards, we count the segmented objects. As nuclei might be counted twice which touch the tile border, we have to correct the count for every tile. Technically, we could remove the objects which touch one of the vertical or horizontal tile borders. However, there is a simpler way for correcting for this error: We count the number of nuclei after segmentation. Then, we remove all nuclei which touch any image border and count the remaining nuclei again. We can then assume that half of the removed nuclei should be counted. Hence, we add the two counts, before and after edge-removal, and compute the average of these two measurements. Especially on large tiles with many nuclei, the remaining error should be negligible.\n",
